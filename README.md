# Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Analysis - SQL Challenge

## Overview

This challenge involves designing tables, importing CSV data into a SQL database, and analyzing the employee data from Pewlett Hackard, a fictional company, during the 1980s and 1990s. The goal is to perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis to answer specific questions about the employee data.

### 1. Data Modeling

- **Inspect CSV Files**: Review the provided CSV files containing employee data.
- **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: Sketch an ERD of the tables using tools like QuickDBD to visualize relationships.

### 2. Data Engineering

- **Table Schema**: Create a table schema for each CSV file, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
- **Table Creation Order**: Ensure tables are created in the correct order to handle foreign keys effectively.
- **CSV Data Import**: Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table, accounting for headers to avoid errors.

### 3. Data Analysis

Answer the following questions using SQL queries:
1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986.
3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
4. List the department number for each employee along with their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5. List the first name, last name, and sex of each employee named Hercules with a last name starting with "B".
6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8. List the frequency counts of all employee last names in descending order.

### Data Engineering

1. **Create Table Schema**:
   - Define the schema for each table, including data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

2. **Create Tables**:
   - Ensure tables are created in the correct order to handle foreign keys.

3. **Import CSV Data**:
   - Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
   - Remember to account for headers to avoid import errors.

### Data Analysis

1. **Query Data**:
   - Use SQL queries to answer the specified questions about the employee data.

## Conclusion

This challenge provided valuable experience in data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis using SQL. By designing table schemas, importing data, and performing complex queries, we gained insights into the employee data of Pewlett Hackard during the 1980s and 1990s.
